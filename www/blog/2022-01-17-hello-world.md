Welcome to Dino-Might!! A sandbox that I am using to get familiar with the features and API provided by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - a static site generator.

The goal is to get to a template that I can repurpose for setting up project-specific blogs, documentation sites or portfolio pages. 

---

Some things I want to explore:

 * `Scaffolding` = what does the boilerplate experience look like?
 * `Deployment` = how easily can I deploy this to various hosting providers?
 * `Tooling` = what dev tools exist for authoring, testing, CI/CD and auditing?
 * `PWA` = how easily can I refactor this to be a progressive web app?
 * `Testing` = how I do implement cross-browser testing and automation?
 * `Authoring` = how do I use MDX and React support for richer UI/UX?
 * `Modern` = how do I design for accessibility, localization, performance?
 * `Integration` = does this play well with others (e.g., frameworks & services)

I'll be overhauling the [Tutorials](/docs/intro) section to document my learnings as I go.
