## 1. What is Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a framework (from Facebook/Meta) to help build single-page applications with a single focus usage: to _write and publish content_.

Key features:

 * Static site generator built with React
 * Markdown authoring, first-class Typescript support
 * Localization support pre-configured (70 languages)
 * Built-in versioning and search support 

[Read the docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for more details - including their [comparison with other tools](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools) like Docsify, Gatsby, Jekyll and more. Try their [Playground](https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground) to explore Docusaurus without installing anything.
